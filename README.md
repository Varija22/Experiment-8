Aim:

To develop a C++ program that takes input for a matrix from the user and displays it in matrix format.


Tools Required:

Programiz

Theory:

A matrix is a two-dimensional array consisting of rows and columns. In C++, matrices can be represented using 2D arrays. Nested loops are used to access each element by its row and column index. This program uses basic C++ concepts such as arrays, loops, and standard input/output to take input and display a matrix in tabular format.


Algorithm:

1. Start
  
2. Declare integer variables `rows`, `cols`, and a 2D array `matrix[100][100]`

3. Prompt the user to enter the number of rows and columns
 
4. Use nested loops to input matrix elements:

   * Outer loop for rows
   * Inner loop for columns
  
5. Use nested loops to display the matrix:

   * Outer loop prints each row
   * Inner loop prints each element followed by a tab space
  
7. End



Conclusion:

The program successfully takes a matrix as input from the user and displays it in matrix format. It demonstrates the use of 2D arrays and nested loops, which are fundamental in handling structured data like matrices in C++.
